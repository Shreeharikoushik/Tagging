# Tagging
The Tags component is a Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) that serves a specific need for Sales and Support reps by centralizing, categorizing and highlighting important Contact information/attributes. This solution provides the flexibility and control of what can be manually added and/or removed in addition to tag record creation automation guidelines.
Why Tags are Used: Tags are used to highlight important contact information/attributes and have it displayed in a central location. Tags donâ€™t need to be a simple text, Tags can be designed to look great and stand out quickly upon loading a contact record, they can be categorized with background and font color and/or icon. Additionally, you gain visibility and reporting.
Purpose/Use case: The purpose of tags is to highlight contact information/attributes by having it accessible in a centralized location, easy to stand out and see for any support staff.
